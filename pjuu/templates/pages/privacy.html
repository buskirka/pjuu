    <h1>Privacy</h1>

        <h1>We are really bothered about Privacy</h1>

        <p>Privacy is our primary concern on Pjuu. We do not care if you sign up with a burn e-mail address or a user name which does not relate to you in any way.</p>

        <p>The e-mail address only needs to be alive long enough to activate your account, you can then delete it after this if you so wish. Be warned, if you forget your password you will not be able to recover your account.</p>

        <p>If you are at all worried about your IP address being known or are in a country with a government who does not allow free access to the internet I strongly suggest using <a href="https://www.torproject.org/" target="_blank">The Onion Router (TOR)</a>.

        <p>We want to be as open as possible about when it comes to your data, the site in general and everything in between. If you have any suggestions please let us know.</p>

        <h1>What information do you collect?</h1>

        <p>We store only the information you provide to Pjuu. We store your sign up form as a user object when the sign up is successful. This includes your username, e-mail and hashed password. We also add some meta data which includes; banned status, muted status, activated status, user ientificationd number, last login, about message (empty by default), last time you checked your alerts, etc. There is nothing stored which would identify you that you didn't type in.</p>

        <p>In the event that you decide to post, comment or vote we also store this data for you within our database.</p>

        <p>We also store some connection information in our webservers log files. This includes the browser you came from and your IP address. This allows us to see if there are any issues related to a browser if for some reason an internal server error is thrown.</p>

        <p>If you are worried about what is being stored on you hop over to <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/pjuu/pjuu">Github</a> and audit this yourself. Everything we keep is to keep the site working and allow us to administer it.</p>

        <h1>How long is my data kept?</h1>

        <p>The data you post on Pjuu, your user account, posts, comments, votes and follows are stored until you either decide to delete them individually or delete your account.</p>

        <p>Further to this, our web server logs and database backups are only kept for 7 days. If you delete your account, post, comment, etc, these will only exist for 7 days at most. They will however be removed from the site immediatley.</p>

        <p><i>We are subject to the laws in the United Kingdom. In the future we may be forced to increase the time this data is kept. If this ever happens we will inform all users immediatley. We will also highlght any legal requests we receive if the site/software becomes large enough to have to deal with this.</i></p>

        <h1>How do you secure this data?</h1>

        <p>All of your data is stored on servers owned by us. These are hosted by <a href="https://www.linode.com" target="_blank">https://www.linode.com</a>.</p>

        <p>All servers are firewalled off to the outside world so only Pjuu administrators have access to this data.</p>

        <p>There are only 2 engineers capable of looking at any of the data stored within our databases. <i>I would like to highlight that the only time we would ever delve in to the database is if there is an issue.</i></p>

        <p>The database backups them selves are encrypted and shipped to another server within the Linode network. The keys to decrpyt this data is stored seperatley from the database backups them selves.</p>

        <h1>Do you use cookies?</h1>

        <p><b>Yes!</b> Don't be alarmed. Cookies are needed so you can sign in. If we could not identify you as being logged in you would not be able to post, comment or anything else.</p>

        <p>In side your cookie is simply an identifier number which allows us to locate your <i>session</i>. The session does not store anything special, it simply has your user identification number and some data which allows us to provide the messages which flash after you post a comment for example.</p>

        <h1>Right got it! What do you do with this data?</h1>

        <p>Nothing. The data stored is to allow you to use the site in what ever way you want. The only thing we do for you is allow people to search for your username and allow other users to see the posts you post.</p>

        <p>I can confirm that we do not analyze your data to sell you anything. We have no adverts and have no desire to profile you.</p>

        <p>Our future goal is to allow you to use the Pjuu network but store the data yourself if you so wish. So it would not make sense to start doing any of the above.</p>

        <h1>What if I have a question?</h1>

        <p>You can email us. If it's about privacy then e-mail use as <a href="mailto:privacy@pjuu.com">privacy@pjuu.com</a>. There are also more contact methods available on our <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/pjuu/pjuu">Github</a>.</p>

        <p>We are not very good at writing what people who do this for a living call "copy", we write code. If we have missed something please let us know. If we ever do receive a request which should be on here we will update this page.</p>
