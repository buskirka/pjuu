### Glyphicons

The icons in this folder are from Glyphicons (http://glyphicons.com/) and they are awesome.

We do own a royalty-free license for these icons, However as we are anopen-source project we have decided to use the "halfling" icons. These are freely available under an MIT licence from Twitter in there Bootstrap project (http://getbootstrap.com/). We made this decision so we can package them up with Pjuu under our AGPLv3 license. We do not use the Bootstrap framework.

Please note that we have changed the names of some of the icons to make it simpler in our templates. We have also changed the color of a few to denote certain actions.
