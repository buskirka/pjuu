I can not include the glyphicons with the git respository. I have a Royalty Free license which makes this tough.
Some of the filenames are also different from the standard ones. I would suggest `grep`ing through the templates/ directory
looking for the references to this folder and you can change from there.

I will come up with a better solution to this.
