## About

The goal of Pjuu is to provide an online community but one where you are in control of your data.

Our main priority is our users privacy. When you no longer want to use the site you can delete your account. This will remove all data that is held on you. This includes your account, every post you made, every comment you made, and everything in between. Your data will exist in backups for 7 days at the most after that there will be nothing.

We are also trying to remove our reliance on external services, soon to go is Gravatar. This will meam your usage will be known by as few people as possible.

Our aim is to be as open and transparent as possible about the site; pjuu.com pulls from this Github repository to the live site there is no hidden code in between.

## Contributing

We are open to all pull requests. Spend some time taking a look around, locate a bug, design issue or spelling mistake then send us a pull request :)

## Security

All software has bugs in and Pjuu is no different. These may have security implications. If you find one that you suspect could allow you to do something you shouldn't be able to please do not post it as an issue on Github. We would really appreciate it if you could send an e-mail to security@pjuu.com with the relevant details.
