## About

The goal of Pjuu is to provide an online community but one where you are in control of your data.

Our main priority is our users privacy. When you no longer want to use the site you can delete your account. This will remove all data that is held on you. This includes your account, every post you made, every comment you made, and everything in between.

Once your account is gone from the site it will only be help in backups for 7 days, the same goes for all web logs so within a week of deleting you can be confident your data is gone.

We are also trying to remove our reliance on external services, soon to go are ReCaptcha and Gravatar. This way you can be sure your online activity on Pjuu is known only by Pjuu and NO ONE else.

If you want to help out why not contribute on Github?

Our aim is to be as open and transparent as possible about the site; pjuu.com pulls for this Github repository to the live site there is no hidden code in between.
